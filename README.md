Welcome to my NAND-To-Tetris project repository! This project is part of the "Nand to Tetris" course, which takes you on a journey from basic logic gates to building a fully functioning computer from scratch. Below, you'll find an overview of each completed assignment, detailing the main objectives and components built in each stage.

## Assignment 1: Boolean Logic

In this assignment, we built the basic building blocks of our computer using NAND gates. These included:

- **Not gate**
- **And gate**
- **Or gate**
- **Xor gate**
- **Multiplexers and Demultiplexers**

These components form the foundation of more complex logic circuits.

## Assignment 2: Boolean Arithmetic

We extended our Boolean logic gates to construct arithmetic operations. This included building:

- **Half adder**
- **Full adder**
- **Add16**
- **Incrementer**

These circuits are essential for performing arithmetic operations within the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit).

## Assignment 3: Sequential Logic

This assignment focused on the construction of sequential logic elements, which are crucial for memory and state management. The components built include:

- **Flip-Flops (DFF)**
- **Registers**
- **RAM8, RAM64, RAM512, RAM4K, RAM16K**

These elements are the backbone of the computer’s memory hierarchy.

## Assignment 4: Machine Language

We learned and implemented a simple machine language specific to our computer architecture. Key tasks included:

- Writing simple programs in the machine language

This provides the groundwork for understanding how high-level code is translated into machine code.

## Assignment 5: Computer Architecture

In this assignment, we built the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and combined it with memory to create a functioning computer. The tasks included:

- Building Memory 
- Designing the CPU control logic
- Integrating the CPU with Memory to form the complete Computer

## Assignment 6: Assembler

We created an assembler that translates assembly language programs into machine code. Key components included:

- Parsing assembly language
- Converting symbols and mnemonics into binary instructions
- Handling variables and labels

## Assignment 7: Virtual Machine I

This assignment involved constructing a virtual machine (VM) that interprets a high-level stack-based language. The tasks included:

- Implementing the VM’s arithmetic and logical operations
- Handling stack operations
- Translating VM commands into assembly code

## Assignment 8: Virtual Machine II

Building on the first part of the VM, we added more complex features, including:

- Implementing branching commands (if-goto, goto)
- Implementing function call and return commands
- Managing function calls with the call stack

## Assignment 10: Compiler I

We started building a compiler that translates a high-level language (Jack) into VM code. The focus in this assignment was on:

- Lexical analysis: tokenizing the input source code
- Parsing: generating the parse tree from the tokens

This lays the groundwork for further stages of the compiler, where we will generate executable VM code from the parse tree.
